### Node.js is Born

- Node.js is a popular tool for building applications.
- JavaScript is a programming language that can be run in a browser.
- A browser has a built-in JavaScript engine that allows it to understand and execute JavaScript code.
- There are different JavaScript engines used by different browsers, such as V8 for Google Chrome and SpiderMonkey for Firefox.
- The question is whether it is possible to run JavaScript outside of a browser, without the need for a browser's JavaScript engine.
- This is where Node.js comes in, as it allows for the execution of JavaScript code outside of a browser.
- The history of Node.js includes key moments that led to its development and popularity, starting with the introduction of JavaScript by the Netscape browser in 1995.
- Brendan Eich developed JavaScript, a programming language for the web.
- In 1996, Netscape introduced Netscape Livewire, a way to create dynamic pages using server-side JavaScript.
- In 2008, Google announced the Chrome browser with the V8 engine, a new and powerful JavaScript engine.
- The V8 engine allowed for fast and performant execution of JavaScript, improving user experiences on websites.
- In 2009, Ryan Dahl created Node.js, with the idea of running the V8 engine outside of the browser.
- Node.js allows for the execution of JavaScript outside of the browser, on servers and other environments.
- This led to the concept of a full-stack developer, someone who can work on both the front-end and back-end of web applications.
- Node.js is now a major player in the programming world.

## Javascript Runtime
- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, not a programming language or framework.
- A runtime is an environment that allows for the execution of code and provides additional features.
- Node.js uses the V8 engine to efficiently execute JavaScript code and automatically benefits from improvements to the V8 engine.
- Node.js also uses the Libuv library to provide additional features, such as support for asynchronous I/O.
- The combination of the V8 engine and Libuv allows Node.js to do more than just execute JavaScript code.
- A web browser provides additional features, such as the window object, that are not part of JavaScript but allow for additional functionality.
- Node.js also provides additional features, such as the global object, that are not part of JavaScript.
- To run JavaScript, a runtime and a JavaScript engine are needed.
- Node.js is a set of tools that allows for the execution of JavaScript outside of the browser.
- Node.js uses the V8 engine to read and execute JavaScript code and the Libuv library to provide additional features.
- Other programming languages, such as Python, also require a runtime to be installed in order to execute code.
