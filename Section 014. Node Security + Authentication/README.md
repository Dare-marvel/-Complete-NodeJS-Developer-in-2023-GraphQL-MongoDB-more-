## Security and Authentication Overview
- The section is about security and authentication.
- Social sign-on will be used to secure node servers.
- Login will be implemented using Google's OAuth.
- Implementing your own authentication using cookies and tokens is not recommended in the real world, especially on large projects where security is important.
- Using well-proven approaches like OAuth can help avoid security flaws.
- In the real world, you'll almost always be using a sign-on service like Okta, Auth0, Amazon Cognito, or social sign-on directly.
- All of these approaches follow a standard like OAuth, which is the most widely used way of doing login on the internet.
- The goal of this section is to teach real-world techniques and not just toy authentication that is good for learning but not applicable to the real world.
- Security and authentication have already been discussed in the course, including topics like cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), whitelisting, the principle of least privilege, and auditing npm packages with the npm audit command.
- Security and authentication are huge topics that will be explored in-depth in the context of node servers.

## Encrypted Connections with SSL and TLS
- Before adding security or authentication, it is important to make sure that node servers use HTTPS, the secure version of the HTTP protocol.
- HTTPS encrypts data in transit as it is being sent over the internet.
- So far, the servers have only handled requests with the HTTP protocol.
- It is always best to make requests to the server using the HTTPS protocol to ensure that data is encrypted while being sent over the internet.
- Using HTTPS keeps the client application secure by sending both requests and responses in a way that is private to the user.
- HTTPS prevents other users from eavesdropping on or tampering with data.
- This is achieved using the SSL or TLS protocols.
- When browsing a site using an unencrypted HTTP connection, anyone with access to the network can read the traffic between the user and the server using a packet analysis tool like Wireshark.
- This is not ideal if the traffic includes sensitive information like a password.
- When browsing a site using an encrypted HTTPS connection, SSL and TLS are used to encrypt the data.
- SSL and TLS are usually used interchangeably, but TLS is actually the successor to SSL and is the latest version of this encrypted protocol.
- SSL has evolved through versions 1, 2, and 3, and then moved on to TLS version 1 and beyond.
- Many people still use the term SSL when referring to TLS, so it is good to be aware of both terms.
- HTTPS does not change the HTTP protocol, but rather wraps HTTP requests and responses in a strongly encrypted connection provided by TLS.
- Only the domain name of the site being browsed is exposed in plain text, while all other data in the request and response are securely encrypted with TLS.
- For example, when browsing Google and running searches, anyone snooping on the connection will know that you are browsing Google.com, but not what you are searching for or what data you are sending and receiving.
- This is because Google uses TLS and the HTTPS protocol to keep data secure.


## Digital Certificates, Signing, and Man In The…
- HTTPS uses SSL and TLS protocols to encrypt HTTP connections.
- An SSL or TLS certificate is required to verify the server's ownership before any encrypted data is sent.
- Digital certificates are used to verify that we are talking to the server we expect and to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Certificates are assigned and signed by a certificate authority, an organization that is trusted to issue valid digital certificates.
- In the past, certificates had to be purchased from certificate authorities, but now there are certificate authorities like Let's Encrypt that allow us to sign certificates for free.
- Let's Encrypt has certain conditions that must be met in order to receive a certificate, such as having a domain name.
- Self-signed certificates can be used for development purposes, but are not useful in production because they are still vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- If a browser detects a self-signed certificate, it will give a warning and only allow access if the user explicitly acknowledges the risk.
- In production, it is always best to use certificates signed by a certificate authority because they are trusted by most clients on the web.
- TLS certificates can be broken down into two categories: those signed by a certificate authority and self-signed certificates.
- In addition to encrypting traffic, TLS certificates also help verify the ownership of the server being communicated with.

## Setting Up Our Security Example
To get your node server to use HTTPS, you need to create an SSL or TLS certificate and use it to verify the server's ownership before any encrypted data is sent. This can be done by using the `https` module in Node.js, which provides a way to transfer data over the HTTP TLS/SSL protocol, the secure version of HTTP³⁴.

Here is an example of how you can create an HTTPS server in Node.js using the `https` module:
```javascript
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem')
};

https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8000);
```
In this example, the `options` object contains the private key and certificate files for the SSL or TLS certificate. These files are read using the `fs` module and passed to the `createServer` method of the `https` module. The server is then started by calling the `listen` method and specifying a port number.

You can also use a package like [Certbot](^8^) to upgrade your server to HTTPS. Certbot will issue you with a new HTTPS certificate and patch your server config files to use it.

## HTTPS With Node, Self Signed Certificates, an…
To use HTTPS in a Node.js server, you can use the built-in `https` module, which provides a way to transfer data over the HTTP TLS/SSL protocol, the secure version of HTTP . This module is similar to the `http` module, but with an additional layer of security provided by SSL/TLS encryption.

Here is an example of how you can create an HTTPS server in Node.js using the `https` module:
```javascript
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem')
};

https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8000);
```
In this example, the `options` object contains the private key and certificate files for the SSL or TLS certificate. These files are read using the `fs` module and passed to the `createServer` method of the `https` module. The server is then started by calling the `listen` method and specifying a port number.

To create an SSL or TLS certificate, you can use a tool like OpenSSL. OpenSSL is an open-source tool that is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. On Windows machines, you can install OpenSSL by installing Git for Windows. On macOS and Linux systems, OpenSSL is likely already installed, or you can get it from the OpenSSL website.

Once you have OpenSSL installed on your machine, you can use it to generate a self-signed certificate by running the `openssl` command with the appropriate options. For example:
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```
This command generates a new self-signed certificate using the RSA encryption format with a key size of 4096 bits. The `-keyout` and `-out` options specify the names of the files where the private key and certificate will be saved.

To use HTTPS in a Node.js server, you need to create an SSL or TLS certificate and use it to verify the server's ownership before any encrypted data is sent. This can be done by using the `https` module in Node.js, which provides a way to transfer data over the HTTP TLS/SSL protocol, the secure version of HTTP .

Here is an example of how you can create an HTTPS server in Node.js using the `https` module:

https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8000);
```
In this example, the `options` object contains the private key and certificate files for the SSL or TLS certificate.

Yes, you can use the `fs` module to read the private key and certificate files synchronously before passing them as options to the `createServer` method of the `https` module. This ensures that both files are available before the server starts listening.

Here is an example of how you can create an HTTPS server in Node.js using the `https` module and the `fs` module to read the private key and certificate files:
```javascript
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem')
};

https.createServer(options, (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8000);
```
In this example, the `options` object contains the private key and certificate files for the SSL or TLS certificate. These files are read using the `fs.readFileSync` method and passed to the `createServer` method of the `https` module. The server is then started by calling the `listen` method and specifying a port number.

## Helmet.js

To summarize, Helmet is an npm package offering a set of middlewares that enhance server security. When integrated into an application, these middlewares collectively tackle various security concerns. They are designed to address widespread problems and can be enabled or disabled as needed. The convenience of having them grouped together in Helmet simplifies the process of securing Node servers.

## Authentication vs Authorization
**Authentication and Authorization Simplified:**

**Need for Login:**
- Many websites want users to log in.
- This is to protect certain parts of the site.
- Not all users should see everything.

**Example Situation:**
- Imagine a site with user data (Andre, Larry, Dwight).
- Users might have secrets they want to keep safe.

**Authentication vs Authorization:**
- **Authentication**: Confirms users are who they say they are.
  - Like proving your identity.
  - Usually, with a username and password.
- **Authorization**: Checks if authenticated users can access something.
  - Like checking if you're allowed to enter a room.

**No Authentication or Authorization:**
- Without these, users are anonymous.
- They can access everything on the site.
- Dwight could see Larry's secrets.

**Securing with Both:**
- With both, the site becomes secure.
- First, authentication to prove identity.
- Then, authorization to check permission.

**Authentication Step:**
- User must log in.
- This proves they are who they claim.
- Could be username/password or biometrics.

**Authorization Check:**
- After authentication, users might want specific access.
- Like, Andre wants to see his own data.
- But he can't access Larry's data.

**Difference and Combination:**
- **Authorization**: Controls what you're allowed to do.
- **Authentication**: Gets you in the door.
- Together, they are sometimes called "auth."

**HTTP Response Codes:**
- 401 (Unauthorized): You're not authenticated (not logged in).
- 403 (Forbidden): You're authenticated, but not authorized (no permission).
- 401's name is a bit confusing; it's more about being unauthenticated.

Remember: Authentication is like the key to your house, and authorization is what rooms you can enter.
